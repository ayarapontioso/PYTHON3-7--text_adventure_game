This is an extension of the exercise in Learning Python the Hard Way (I think ~ex27?) that I add stuff to from time to time.  It's mostly just to test out different things to see how well i've learned them.

To do list:
		fix all of those globalssssss (maybe a list to better control the state of the room/inventory?)

	add more items
	
	
	fights
		health
		combat system
		items
		monsters
